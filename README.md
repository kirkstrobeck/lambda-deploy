# Lambda kit

**A strategy for working with lambdas.**

**What it does**

- Run Lambdas locally
- Deploy all Lambdas locally
- Deploy all Lambdas via CI

This is an opinionated setup for your API, where lambdas reside together. Obviously you could use this and then bring in lambdas as submodules or packages if you wanted to maintain seperate reops.

All assets within the lambda are wrapped up in a ZIP and pushed. Node modules can be easily added. Packages that require more advanced processing may need to be [compiled against lambda infrastucture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nodejs-packages-in-lambda/), but this is rare. There are a [few](https://medium.com/@kirkstrobeck/aws-lambda-node-modules-176f89471364) built-in Node modules that are available.

### Usage

This project has a detailed example in `./example`. To run the example, `cd` into that directory and `npm_install` and run commands from there.

To run a Lambda

```bash
node node_modules/lambdakit --run=weather
```

### Config

1) Add this to `package.json` (You can omit if your values are the same as these are defaults).

```json
"lambdakit": {
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "path-to-lambdas": "/lib"
}
```

- `region` the AWS region where your Lambdas reside
- `path-to-lambdas` is the path to the folder that holds the lambdas. Currently each folder that holds lambda contents needs to match the lambda name in AWS.

2) Add `config.lambdakit.js` for local deploy (You can omit if using [local cli config](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration). Contents:

```js
process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'XXX';
process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'XXX';
```

2b) To deploy on commit from your CI server, install credentials on your project in the CI settings. In the case of [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), itâ€™s done with a URI similar to `https://circleci.com/gh/myOrg/myProject/edit#aws`

3) Update your `.gitignore` to include the following, as your nested lambdas will be projects in and of themselves.

```bash
**/node_modules/**
/exports/*
/config.aws.lambda.js
```

## Roadmap

- Test coverage
- Compare diff to only push changed lambdas
